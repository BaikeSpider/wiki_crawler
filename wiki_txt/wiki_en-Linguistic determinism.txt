Linguistic determinism
Linguistic determinism is the idea that language and its structures limit and determine human knowledge or thought, as well as thought processes such as categorization, memory, and perception. The term implies that people who speak different languages as their mother tongues have different thought processes.[1] Though it played a considerable role historically, linguistic determinism is now discredited among mainstream linguists.[2]
