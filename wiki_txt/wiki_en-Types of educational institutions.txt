Educational institution
An educational institution is a place where people of different ages gain an education.[1] Examples of some institutions are preschools, primary schools, secondary schools, and further and higher education. They provide a large variety of learning environments and learning spaces. The American Educational System typically divides learning facilities by an age grade system. The student is designated to a grade level based on their age, and advances one grade each year. This determines what educational institution would be an appropriate setting for the individual. The institution can be public, private or unconventional.
