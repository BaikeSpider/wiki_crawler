Ontological hermeneutics
In psychotherapy, ontological hermeneutics is a phenomenological theory of human nature.[1] Hermeneutic psychotherapy is an application of phenomenological hermeneutic philosophy. It is related to, but different from other forms of philosophical hermeneutics like biblical hermeneutics (limited to interpretation of sacred texts) or radical hermeneutics (the process of radical deconstruction of meaning). Although related to other, more widely known, theories of psychotherapy like person-centered and existential therapy, hermeneutic psychotherapy does not yet have an established body of empirical support.[2][3]
