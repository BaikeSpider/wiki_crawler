Educational leadership
School leadership is the process of enlisting and guiding the talents and energies of teachers, pupils, and parents toward achieving common educational aims. This term is often used synonymously with educational leadership in the United States and has supplanted educational management in the United Kingdom. Several universities in the United States offer graduate degrees in educational leadership.[1] Certain obstacles of educational leadership can be overcome.[2] A self-assessment technique can help examine equity and justice that affects student diversity, especially with selection of candidates.[3]
