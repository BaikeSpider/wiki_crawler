Prosocial behavior
Prosocial behavior, or "voluntary behavior intended to benefit another",[1] is a social behavior that "benefit[s] other people or society as a whole",[2] "such as helping, sharing, donating, co-operating, and volunteering".[3] Obeying the rules and conforming to socially accepted behaviors (such as stopping at a "Stop" sign or paying for groceries) are also regarded as prosocial behaviors.[4] These actions may be motivated by empathy and by concern about the welfare and rights of others,[5] as well as for egoistic or practical concerns, such as one's social status or reputation, hope for direct or indirect reciprocity, or adherence to one's perceived system of fairness.[1] It may also be motivated by altruism, though the existence of pure altruism is somewhat disputed, and some have argued that this falls into philosophical rather than psychological realm of debate.[6] Evidence suggests that pro sociality is central to the well-being of social groups across a range of scales, including schools. Prosocial behavior in the classroom can have a significant impact on a studentâ€™s motivation for learning and contributions to the classroom and larger community.[7][8] Empathy is a strong motive in eliciting prosocial behavior, and has deep evolutionary roots.[9][10]
