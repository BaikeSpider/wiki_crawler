Functionalism (philosophy of mind)
Functionalism is a view in the theory of the mind. It states that mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.) are constituted solely by their functional role â€“ that is, they have causal relations to other mental states, numerous sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs.[1] Functionalism developed largely as an alternative to the identity theory of mind and behaviorism.
