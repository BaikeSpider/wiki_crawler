Meaning (existential)
Meaning in existentialism is descriptive; therefore it is unlike typical, prescriptive conceptions of "the meaning of life".[citation needed] Due to the methods of existentialism, prescriptive or declarative statements about meaning are unjustified.[citation needed] Meaning is something only for an individual; it has a home only in one person.[clarification needed] The verb "to mean" implies something exists to be taken or learned from something else; and since subjects mean different things to every individual, meaning is purely subjective. Thus it is 'subjective' or should be understood to have an 'anti-system' or 'anti-answer' sensibility.[1][not in citation given]
