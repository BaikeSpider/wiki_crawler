Solo Man
Solo Man (Homo erectus soloensis) was formerly classified as Homo sapiens soloensis and is now regarded as a subspecies of the extinct hominin, Homo erectus. Discovered between 1931 and 1933 by Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald,[1] the only known specimens of this anomalous hominid were retrieved from sites along the Solo River, on the Indonesian island of Java. The remains are also commonly referred to as Ngandong (now at Kradenan district, Blora Regency), after the village near where they were first recovered.
