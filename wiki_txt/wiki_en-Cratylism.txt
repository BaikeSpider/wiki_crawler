Cratylism
Cratylism as a philosophical theory reflects the teachings of the Athenian Cratylus (Ancient Greek: Κρατύλος, also transliterated as Kratylos), fl. mid to late 5th century BCE. The term in philosophy comes about from Plato's classic dialogue, Cratylus. Vaguely exegetical, it holds that the fluid nature of ideas, words, and communications leaves them fundamentally baseless, and possibly unable to support logic and reason. Within the dialogue, those philosophical positions of Hermogenes and Cratylus are now what are referred to as ‘conventionalism’ and ‘naturalism.’
