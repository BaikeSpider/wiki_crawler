Philosophy of computer science
The philosophy of computer science is concerned with the philosophical questions that arise with the study of computer science, which is understood to mean not just programming but the whole study of concepts and methods that assist in the development and maintenance of computer systems.[1] There is still no common understanding of the content, aim, focus, or topic of the philosophy of computer science,[2] despite some attempts to develop a philosophy of computer science like the philosophy of physics or the philosophy of mathematics.
