Affective neuroscience is the study of the neural mechanisms of emotion. This interdisciplinary field combines neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood.[1] The putative existence of 'basic emotions' and their defining attributes represents a long lasting and yet unsettled issue in psychology.[2]
