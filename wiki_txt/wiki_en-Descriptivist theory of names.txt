Descriptivist theory of names
The descriptivist theory of proper names is that the meaning or semantic content of a proper name is identical to the descriptions associated with it by speakers, while their referents are determined to be the objects that satisfy these descriptions. Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege have both been associated with the descriptivist theory, which is sometimes called the Fregeâ€“Russell theory.[1]
