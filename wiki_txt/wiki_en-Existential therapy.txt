Existential therapy
Existential psychotherapy is a form of psychological therapy that, like the existential philosophy which underlies it, is founded upon the belief that human existence is best understood through a direct examination of our own experiences, as well as those concepts that are universally applicable to human existence such as death, freedom, responsibility, meaning, etc.[1] Existential therapy stresses the freedom and responsibility of the individual, and aims to find ways by which individuals may live in order to facilitate a greater degree of meaning in their lives. This involves the philosophical exploration and adjustment in many areas of a person's life. Rather than being a specific means of assessing and treating patients, existential therapy is a philosophical approach to psychotherapy that emphasizes these concepts and their importance for wellbeing.[2]
