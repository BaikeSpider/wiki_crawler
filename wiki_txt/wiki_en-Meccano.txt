Meccano
Meccano is a model construction system created in Liverpool, United Kingdom, by Frank Hornby. The brand now maintains a manufacturing facility in Calais, France.[1] Meccano consists of reusable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles and gears, and plastic parts that are connected together using nuts, bolts and set screws (also known as grub screws). It enables the building of working models and mechanical devices. Although Meccano has always been seen as an engaging educational toy, today the brand focuses on promoting engineering and robotics through fun play to support STEM learning.
