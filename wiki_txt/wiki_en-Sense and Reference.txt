Sense and reference
In the philosophy of language, the distinction between sense and reference was an innovation of the German philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege in 1892 (in his paper "On Sense and Reference"; German: "Ãœber Sinn und Bedeutung"),[1] reflecting the two ways he believed a singular term may have meaning.
