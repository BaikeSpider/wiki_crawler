Garage sale
A garage sale (also known as a yard sale, tag sale, moving sale and by many other names[1]) is an informal event for the sale of used goods by private individuals, in which sellers are not required to obtain business licenses or collect sales tax (though, in some jurisdictions, a permit may be required).
