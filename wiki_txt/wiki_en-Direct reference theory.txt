Direct reference theory
A direct reference theory (also called referentialism[1] or referential realism)[2] is a theory of language that claims that the meaning of a word or expression lies in what it points out in the world.[3] The object denoted by a word is called its referent. Criticisms of this position are often associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein.[1]
