Occupational health psychology
Occupational health psychology (OHP) is an interdisciplinary area of psychology that is concerned with the health and safety of workers.[1][2][3] OHP addresses a number of major topic areas including the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health, the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health, work-family balance, workplace violence and other forms of mistreatment, accidents and safety, and interventions designed to improve/protect worker health.[1][2] OHP emerged from two distinct disciplines within applied psychology, namely, health psychology and industrial and organizational psychology, as well as occupational medicine.[4] OHP has also been informed by other disciplines including industrial sociology, industrial engineering, and economics,[5] as well as preventive medicine and public health.[6] OHP is concerned with the relationship of psychosocial workplace factors to the development, maintenance, and promotion of workers' health and that of their families.[1][6] Thus the field's focus is work-related factors that can lead to injury, disease, and distress.
