Development studies
Development studies is an interdisciplinary branch of social science. Development studies is offered as a specialized master's degree in a number of universities, and, less commonly, as an undergraduate degree. It has grown in popularity as a subject of study since the early 1990s, and has been most widely taught and researched in the third world and in countries with a colonial history, such as the UK, where development studies originated.[1] Students of development studies often choose careers in international organisations such as the United Nations, World Bank, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), private sector development consultancy firms, corporate social responsibility (CSR) bodies and research centers.
