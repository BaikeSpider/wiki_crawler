Descriptive psychology
Descriptive psychology (DP) is primarily a conceptual framework for the science of psychology. Created in its original form by Peter G. Ossorio at the University of Colorado at Boulder in the mid-1960s,[1][2] it has subsequently been the subject of hundreds of books and papers that have updated, refined, and elaborated it, and that have applied it to domains such as psychotherapy,[3] artificial intelligence,[4][5] organizational communities,[6] spirituality,[7] research methodology,[8] and theory creation.[9]
