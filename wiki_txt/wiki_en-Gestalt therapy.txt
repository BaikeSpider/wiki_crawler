Gestalt therapy
Gestalt therapy is an existential/experiential form of psychotherapy that emphasizes personal responsibility, and that focuses upon the individual's experience in the present moment, the therapistâ€“client relationship, the environmental and social contexts of a person's life, and the self-regulating adjustments people make as a result of their overall situation.
