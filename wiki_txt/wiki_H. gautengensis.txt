Homo gautengensis
Homo gautengensis is a hominin species proposed by biological anthropologist Darren Curnoe in 2010. The species is composed of South African hominin fossils previously attributed to Homo habilis, Homo ergaster, or, in some cases, Australopithecus, and is argued by Curnoe to be the earliest species in the genus Homo.[1]
