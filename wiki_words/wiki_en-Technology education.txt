Technology education is the study of technology, in which students "learn about the processes and knowledge related to technology".[1] As a field of study, it covers the human ability to shape and change the physical world to meet needs, by manipulating materials and tools with techniques.
Technology education should not be confused with educational technology. Educational technology focuses on a more narrow subset of technology use that revolves around the use of technology in and for education as opposed to technology education's focus on technology's use in general.[2]
History[edit]
In 1980, through what was called the "Futuring Project", the name of "Industrial Arts Education" was changed to be "Technology Education" in New York State; the goal of this movement was to increase students' technological literacy.[3]
In the 21st century, Mars suit design was utilized as a topic for technology education.[4]
