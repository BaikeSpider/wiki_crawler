WARNING: Part or all of the Book Creator software may currently be disabled while a completely rewritten version is being installed. For the latest information, see here.





At the time of writing, you can create a book and upload it to Pedia Press for print-on-demand rendering and ordering in (approximately) A5 format.
For Help with downloading a Wikipedia page as a PDF, see Help:Download as PDF.
An alternative open source tool, MediaWiki2LaTeX, is also available and works with any website running MediaWiki, such as Wikipedia and Wikibooks.





Information in this page may relate to an earlier version, which has now been disabled.


Status last updated 16 December 2017.



Overview

A Wikipedia Book is an organized collection of Wikipedia articles that can be rendered electronically in PDF format, or ordered as a printed book. The book is compiled afresh each time it is downloaded or ordered, so will always reflect the latest versions of the articles.
Note: Currently (2017) not all information in an article will be displayed when rendered in book format - in particular, since 2014 information held in tables (including infoboxes) has not been displayed. Nor has maths markup.
For information and help on Wikipedia books in general, see Help:Books (general tips) and WikiProject Wikipedia-Books (questions and assistance).
