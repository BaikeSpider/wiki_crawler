Ludwig Noiré (26 March 1829 – 27 March 1889) was German philosopher, known for his studies involving the philosophy of language. He was born in Alzey.
He received his education at the University of Giessen, and later relocated to Mainz, where he worked as a grammar school teacher.[1]
Alexander Bogdanov attributed some of his ideas, formalized as tektology, on the development of a monistic system to Ludwig Noire.
