Value education is the process by which people give moral values to others.[1] It can be an activity that can take place in any organisation during which people are assisted by others, who may be older, in a condition experienced to make explicit our in order to assess the effectiveness of these values and associated behaviour for their own and others' long term well-being, and to reflect on and acquire other values and behaviour which they recognise as being more effective for long term well-being of self and others.

Definitions[edit]
There has been very little reliable research on the results of values education classes, but there are some encouraging preliminary results.[2]
One definition refers to it as the process that gives young people an initiation into values, giving knowledge of the rules needed to function in this mode of relating to other people, and to seek the development in the student a grasp of certain underlying principles, together with the ability to apply these rules intelligently, and to have the settled disposition to do so[3] Some researchers use the concept values education as an umbrella of concepts that includes moral education and citizenship education[4][5][6] Themes that values education can address to varying degrees are character, moral development, Religious Education, Spiritual development, citizenship education, personal development, social development and cultural development.[7]
There is a further distinction between explicit values education and implicit values education[8][9] where:

explicit values education is associated with those different pedagogies, methods or programmes that teachers or educators use in order to create learning experiences for students when it comes to value questions.

Another definition of value education is "learning about self and wisdom of life" in a self exploratory, systematic and scientific way through formal education.
Commonality in many "educations"[edit]

Moral education

Morals as socio-legal-religious norms are supposed to help people behave responsibly. However, not all morals lead to responsible behavior. Values education can show which morals are "bad" morals and which are "good". The change in behavior comes from confusing questions about right and wrong.[10][11][12][13]
American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg who specialized in research on moral education and reasoning, and was best known for his theory of stages of moral development, believed children needed to be in an environment that allowed for open and public discussion of day-to-day conflicts and problems to develop their moral reasoning ability.[14][15][16]

Teacher education

Cross has made a start at documenting some teacher training attempts.[17]
Multinational school-based values education schemes[edit]
Living Values Education Programme (LVEP)[edit]
This project of worldwide proportions inspired by the new religious movement called the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University incorporates twelve values (unity, peace, happiness, hope, humility, simplicity, trust, freedom, co-operation, honesty, courage, love),[18] and has formed the basis of thekiss whole-school ethos approach in schools such as West Kidlington Primary School, Kidlington whose head master Neil Hawkes and Values education coordinators Linda Heppenstall used the work and other programmes to help them form a values-based school.[19][20] The LVEP website lists 54 countries where values education projects are undertaken.[21]
Human Values Foundation[edit]
The Human Values Foundation was established in 1995 to make available worldwide, a comprehensive values-themed programme for children from 4 to 12 years entitled "Education in Human Values". Its fully resourced lesson plans utilise familiar teaching techniques of discussion, story-telling, quotations, group singing, activities to reinforce learning and times of quiet reflection. Following the success of "EHV", a second programme was published – Social and Emotional Education ("SEE"), primarily for ages 12 to 14+ but it has also proved constructive for older children identified as likely to benefit from help getting their lives 'back on track'. The programmes enable children and young people to explore and put into practice a wide spectrum of values with the potential to enrich their lives. Through the experiential learning, over time participants develop a well considered personal morality, all the while gaining invaluable emotional and social skills to help them lead happy, fulfilled, successful lives.
Character education[edit]
Main article: Character education
Character education is an umbrella term generally used to describe the teaching of children in a manner that will help them develop as personal and social beings. However, this definition requires research to explain what is meant by "personal and social being". Concepts that fall under this term include social and emotional learning, moral reasoning/cognitive development, life skills education, health education; violence prevention, critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and conflict resolution and mediation. Lickona (1996) mentions eleven principles of successful character education.[22] It seems to have been applied in the UK[23] and the United States[24]
Science of Living[edit]
Science of Living (Jeevan Vigyan; Jeevan = Life and Vigyan = Science) is a detailed program that complements the current educational approach with spiritual and value based learning. While both mental and physical development is needed for a student's growth, Jeevan Vigyan adds a third pillar – that of emotional intelligence and morality (or values) – to education in schools and colleges. A combination of theory and practice, Jeevan Vigyan draws on the findings of various life-sciences as well as nutritional sciences. Our parasympathetic nervous system and endocrinal system are known to be the drivers of our emotions and our behavior. These biological centers can be influenced Science of Living through a system of yogic exercises, breathing exercises, medication and contemplation. Science of Living's source of inspiration is Jain Acharya Ganadhipati Shri Tulsi (1914–1997). His thoughts were further developed and expanded by Acharya Shri Mahapragya (1920–2010). Currently Muni Shri Kishan Lal Ji, under the leadership of Acharya Shri Mahashraman, is the Principal of SOL.;[25][26]
Examples of values education from around the world[edit]
Taylor[27] gives a thorough overview of values education in 26 European countries.
Australia[edit]
The Australian Government currently funds Values education in its schools, with its own publications and funding of school forums on values education at all levels of education. It also helps in becoming a better person.[28] A conference on "Moral Education and Australian Values" was held in 2007 at Monash University.[29]
India[edit]
The Indian Government currently promote Values education in its schools. The Ministry of Human Resource Development has taken strong step to introduce values among schools and teachers training centers. Also India is known as the land of introducing values. In India, under the leadership of B. Shaji Kumar, New Golden Education Trust (NGET), values Based Education has been progressing throughout the country among schools from first standard to twelve std class.
Indonesia[edit]
A key feature of education in Indonesia is the five principles of Pancasila.[30]
Japan[edit]
Elementary school and middle school students from first to ninth grades will be taught the importance of life, to listen to others with different opinions, to be fair, respect their country and learn about foreign cultures.
Philippines[edit]
For Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao (EsP) (the version of the Values Education in the Philippines), the signs or basic skills of functional literacy decides and acts toward common good with accountability.It means, EsP aims to cultivate and develop the ethical character of students. The EsP aims to guide the student to find the meaning of his life, his role in society to share in building the community the operative truth, freedom, justice and love. To demonstrate this, she must possess five basic skills: understanding, reflection, consultation, decision and action.
Singapore[edit]
Teacher training institutions in Singapore all have curricular for learning to teach civics and moral education programmes – but students do not take these as seriously as they should due to lack of assessment. The reason has been said to be the lack of innovative teaching approaches such as the discourse pedagogy.[31]
Slovenia[edit]
There is an obligatory school subject that includes the aspect of values education and Citizenship Culture and Ethics. It is taught in 7th or 8th grade of primary school. Besides this there are two elective subjects that partly deal with values education: Religions and Ethics (for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade) and Philosophy for children (Critical thinking, Ethical exploring, Me and the other; for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade). Slovenian educational system does not require special training in the field of values education for teachers that teach mentioned subjects .
Sweden[edit]
Values education is a part of Swedish schools. Whereas the formal curricula is about educating students to be competent democratic citizens by practising student participation, qualitative studies have shown that in everyday school life, values education and school democracy often appeared to be reduced to traditional disciplining with high focus on rules and regulations.[32][33][34] This in turn evokes some critiques among students.[35][36][37][38] Most research on values education in Sweden is done by qualitative methods, especially ethnographic or field studies as well as focus group and interview studies.[37][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] Some studies have been conducted by survey and other quantitative methods.[61][62][63] In addition, theoretical work with roots in Dewey and Habermas has been done on deliberative democracy and deliberative conversations in schools.[64][65][66][67][68]
Thailand[edit]
In Thailand, values have traditionally been taught within the context of Buddhist religious education. Since 1982 there has been a revival of applied values as an extracurricular activity suitable for Buddhist, Moslem and Christian students alike to prepare Thai students for the effects of globalization.[69]
United Kingdom[edit]
Since 1988 the British government, although not recognising or calling it values education, has promoted and respected values in the guise of spiritual, moral, social and cultural development (SMSCD) leaving the initiative to individual schools to decide how values education standards should be met. It is not clear whether there are standards of values education. It should be noted that the Government and state school systems have never called it "values education". Values education courses in Britain may be implemented in the form of government supported campaigns such as Social & Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL,[70] but are more often provided by local experts in the form of LVEP.[citation needed]
