The University of Calgary (U of C or UCalgary) is a public research university located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The University of Calgary started in 1944 as the Calgary branch of the University of Alberta, founded in 1908, prior to being instituted into a separate, autonomous university in 1966. It is composed of 14 faculties and over 85 research institutes and centres. The main campus is located in the northwest quadrant of the city near the Bow River and a smaller south campus is located in the city center.
The University of Calgary was ranked #1 in both Canada and North America by the QS World Universities Ranking (Top 50 under 50) and the Times Higher Education Rankings (Top 150 under 50) in 2016.[5] Its enrollment is approximately 25,000 undergraduate and 5,000 graduate students with over 170,000+ alumni[6] in 152 countries, including James Gosling, OC who invented the Java computer language, former Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, former Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk, and Lululemon Athletica founder, Chip Wilson.
A member of the U15, the University of Calgary is also one of Canada's top research universities (based on the number of Canada Research Chairs). The university has a sponsored research revenue of $360.5 million,[7] with total revenues exceeding $1.1 billion, which is one of the highest in Canada. Being in Calgary, with Canada's highest concentration of engineers and geoscientists, the university maintains close ties to the petroleum and geoscience industry through the Department of Geosciences and the Schulich School of Engineering while also maintaining a history of environmental research and leadership, primarily through the Faculty of Environmental Design, the School of Public Policy and the Faculty of Law.
The main campus houses most of the research facilities and works with provincial and federal research and regulatory agencies, several of which are housed next to the campus such as the Geological Survey of Canada. The main campus covers approximately 200 hectares (490 acres).

History[edit]
The University of Calgary was established in 1966, but its roots date back more than half a century earlier to the establishment of the Normal School in Calgary in 1905. The Alberta Normal School was established in Calgary to train primary and secondary school teachers in the new province.[8] The University of Alberta began operating a campus in Calgary in 1944. The University of Alberta Calgary Branch eventually gained full autonomy in 1966 and became the University of Calgary. The University of Calgary tartan is associated with the university and with its pipe band.[9]
The university was modelled on the American state university (similar to the University of Alberta), with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was a link between the bodies to perform institutional leadership.[10]
In the early 20th century, professional education expanded beyond theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.[10] The university's first president, Herbert Stoker Armstrong, held a strong belief that "although the university is accountable to the society that supports it, the university must insist on playing a leadership role in intellectual matters if it is to be worthy of the name."[11]
During the late 1960s, the University of Calgary's campus expanded dramatically with new buildings for engineering and science, the opening of the new University Theatre in Calgary Hall and, in 1971, the launch of the program in architecture. In addition, the Banff Centre (originally known as The Banff School of Fine Arts) affiliated with the University of Calgary in 1966.[10]
The University of Calgary played a central role in facilitating and hosting Canada's first winter olympic games, the XV Olympic Winter Games in 1988.
Academics[edit]
Profile[edit]
The university offers 250 programs in post-secondary education awarding bachelors, masters, and doctorate (PhD) degrees. The University of Calgary has developed a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs.[10] The campus has an area of 200 hectares (490 acres) and hosts 14 faculties, 55 departments and 85 research institutes and centers (see Canadian university scientific research organizations).
With the economic boom in Alberta, the government has promised $4.5 billion to post-secondary institutions in the province.[12]

Libraries and Cultural Resources[edit]
Libraries and Cultural Resources (LCR) includes eight libraries, two art galleries, Archives and Special Collections, the University of Calgary Copyright Office, Research Data Centre and the University of Calgary Press.[16]
MacKimmie library was the first library to open at the University of Calgary in 1966. Since then, five different library branches have been opened in order to provide students with a greater amount of literary choice in many subjects. In addition, the University of Calgary has the first library system in North America to contain a video game library.[17] Over 3.7 million printed volumes combined with online access to more than 300,000 full-text electronic journals and more than 800 electronic databases are available at the university. As of 2012, the library system is the eighth largest, by the number of volumes held, in Canada.[18] In 2011–2012 the university library was rated 43rd in North America for Total Library Expenditures by the Association of Research Libraries.[19]
Branch libraries[edit]
The library system at the University of Calgary also has seven library branches:

Taylor Family Digital Library - contains the greatest share of the library system's printed volumes, as well as rare special items like a gaming collection. In 2011 The Taylor Family Digital Library replaced, as the university's primary facility, the MacKimmie Library, which is no longer a library.

Data Library
Canadian Architectural Archives
Fine Arts and Visual Resources


High Density Library - located at the university's Spy Hill Campus, serves as a climate-controlled repository for lesser-used materials, which may be called-back for use as required.
Business Library, including the Virtual Business Library
Doucette Education Library
Bennett Jones Law Library, including the Virtual Law Library
Health Sciences Library
Gallagher Library of Geology and Geophysics
The Military Museums Library and Archives

Taylor Family Digital Library[edit]
The Taylor Family Digital Library (TFDL) is a convergence of libraries, historical archives, arts museum, scholarly publishing, and student academic support services. The TFDL was officially launched on October 20, 2011.[20] The TFDL allows the full re-engineering of the university's library system, creating more and better space for teaching and learning resources, while moving the majority of the University of Calgary's growing collection off campus to a high-density library.[21] In addition, The TFDL offers books and online resources, a large Learning Commons with café, workrooms, film and audio rooms, editing and recording suites, multimedia labs, quiet study areas, and seminar and consultation space for academic growth.
Don and Ruth Taylor, longtime supporters of the University of Calgary, donated $25 million in December, 2006 to help build the new digital library. In recognition of the gift, the Board of Governors of the University named the library the Taylor Family Digital Library (TFDL).[22]
In addition, the gift will also be used to create the Taylor Quadrangle, a green space in the centre of campus adjacent to the TFDL.
The Taylor Family Digital Library is home to the Nickle Galleries, formerly known as the Nickle Arts Museum, which features exhibits of contemporary art, as well as rugs, textiles, and numismatic items from its collections.[23]

Campuses[edit]
Main Campus[edit]
The university grounds lie about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) north of Downtown Calgary, and immediately south of the neighbourhood of Varsity. The University of Calgary campus occupies 213 hectares (530 acres) or 2.13 km2 (0.82 sq mi), an area larger than Calgary's entire downtown. The campus is bounded by Crowchild Trail, 32 Avenue NW, Shaganappi Trail, and 24 Avenue N.W..
The architecture is defined by a combination of Brutalist and Postmodern buildings spread across campus, most of them built between 1960 and 1980. In 2016, the campus finished repurposing and renovating the Canadian Natural Resources Limited Engineering Complex[38] situated within the Schulich School of Engineering. In 2017, the university has recently started on rehabilitating the aging MacKimmie Complex.
A light rail transit link is provided to the university by the C-Train at the LRT station.
A large park is built in the center of the main campus, and is home to several specially commissioned sculptures. In addition, a pond surrounded by benches and an open field is available. The park contains old oak trees which were specially transplanted to the location when the university was opened. Together, they form a considerable amount of tree canopies which add a more natural feeling to the campus.[39]
West Campus[edit]
In 1995, the Province of Alberta gave the University of Calgary a large tract of land west of the Main Campus with the understanding it would be used in the future to advance the University's mission, vision, values and priorities. About a third of the size of downtown Calgary, the land overlooks the Bow River valley and covers 80 hectares (198 acres) east of Shaganappi Trail between 16th Avenue (TransCanada Highway) and 32 Avenue N.W. The western campus lies on mostly hilly terrain, near the Bow River. It is adjacent to the main campus of the university, and is home to the Alberta Children's Hospital and Child Development Centre. With the recent boost in annual funding, the university has begun a development plan in order to make better use of the remaining space. Dubbed the University District, the area is to include a mixture of residential and commercial development.
Part of the West Campus was leased for the new Alberta Children's Hospital and a new Ronald McDonald House. Currently, the campus is only halfway developed and is considered building room for the future. From this location, it is possible to see the entire university and also Downtown Calgary.[40]
Health Sciences Campus[edit]
The University of Calgary Board of Governors chose to launch a medical school in the late 1960s, with the first tangible building to house this endeavor being the Health Sciences Building, which opened in 1972. The Health Sciences Building shared a site with the Foothills Medical Centre some distance south of the Main Campus. This site became known as the Health Sciences Campus, with subsequent additions being the Heritage Medical Building (opened 1987), the Health Research Innovation Centre and the Teaching, Research and Wellness building.[41]
Downtown Campus[edit]
On September 13, 2010, the University of Calgary opened its new downtown campus located at 8th Avenue and 8th Street S.W.. The building houses classes including Continuing Education, and energy & environment, as well as classes offered by the Haskayne School of Business and the new University of Calgary School of Public Policy.[42] It also houses administrative offices for the Development and Alumni Engagement division and the main office of the University of Calgary Alumni association. It also includes a conference centre. At one point it also included a branch of the university library, but this was decommissioned and converted into additional student study space in 2016.
School of Public Policy[edit]
The School of Public Policy is an institute at the University of Calgary and was founded in 2008 and now based out of the Downtown Campus. The school is devoted to public policy research and education, and is led by economist Dr. Jack Mintz who is cross-appointed to the Faculty of Law. It is home to over 60 faculty and fellows. The school is organized into three policy areas: Economic and Social Policy, Energy and Environmental Policy, and International Policy. Since 2012 the school has offered a graduate degree program, the Master of Public Policy. The degree is structured as a 12-month program involving two semesters of classroom-based learning and one semester of project work. Other degree programs offered include a joint Master of Business Administration/Master of Public Policy and a joint Juris Doctor/Master of Public Policy.
Spy Hill Campus[edit]
The university also operates a satellite campus in the far northwest corner of Calgary on 85 Street N.W. The campus is home to the university's new Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and the High-Density Library, a climate-controlled warehouse for books and other printed material for which there is no longer storage room at the main library.[43]
Qatar Campus[edit]
In 2007, the University of Calgary established a campus in Doha, Qatar, the University of Calgary in Qatar (UCQ), which currently focuses upon nursing education. The University of Calgary in Qatar offers a flexible, innovative, Bachelor of Nursing (BN) degree to prepare students for the opportunities and challenges of a rewarding nursing career. Throughout the program, students are provided with a theoretical base and supervised clinical experience in a variety of nursing practice settings.
The University of Calgary in Qatar offers two routes towards a Bachelor of Nursing (BN) degree:[44]

A Regular Track program for high school - Qatar transfer students (BNRT)
A Post-Diploma program for students with an acceptable Nursing diploma (PDBN)

The University of Calgary in Qatar also offers a Diploma of Nursing program that launched in September 2012.[45]
In addition, several graduate programs are expected to be phased in.[46] Currently the University of Calgary in Qatar campus offers a Master of Nursing program which is sponsored by the Hamad Medical Corporation[47] with focuses in Nursing Leadership and Oncology.

The men's hockey team plays at Father David Bauer Olympic Arena, while the women's hockey team's schedule is split between the Olympic Oval and Father David Bauer Olympic Arena. In the rare case of scheduling conflicts, both men's and women's hockey have used the Max Bell Centre for games.
The University of Calgary has been associated with the Olympics since 1972 when enrolled student and swimming team coach Ralph Hutton competed in Munich. Four years later, in 1976, the 10-year-old athletic department sent three athletes to Montreal. Since then, 42 Dinos athletes have competed at both the summer and winter Games, bringing home 11 medals, and UC hosted the athletes' village and speed skating events at the XV Olympic Winter Games in 1988.[citation needed]
The football team plays home matches at McMahon Stadium, home of CFL's Calgary Stampeders. It has won the Vanier Cup on four occasions, 1983, 1985, 1988 and 1995. In recent years, the team played in the Vanier Cup in 2009, 2010 and 2013.[54]

Student life[edit]
The Den and Black Lounge[edit]
The Den and Black Lounge is the campus bar located in MacEwan Hall, the student centre located in the middle of main campus. Occupying two floors, with the Den located on the lower floor and the Black Lounge on the upper floor, in the warmer months of the year the second floor features a large outdoor patio. Once run by the University of Calgary, the Den was taken over by the Students' Union in 2000.[65]
The Last Defence Lounge[edit]
The Last Defence Lounge (LDL) is a fully licensed restaurant operated by the Graduate Students' Association of the University of Calgary. It is open to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty, staff and members of the public.[66]
Campus Traditions[edit]

The Empty Space: currently serves as an alternative space to study or enjoy arts performances. It regularly hosts the campus Yoga sessions throughout the year.
Student Appreciation Night: Every Thursday The Den (the campus bar) is filled to capacity and serves cheap drinks to a mostly undergraduate crowd.
Bermuda Shorts Day (BSD) is an annual end-of-term tradition for the University of Calgary, usually celebrated around the close of winter semester every April. As the name suggests, students traditionally wear Bermuda shorts. Recent trends however have seen the rise of bright-neon and floral attire instead of the short formal trouser. The event is notorious for turning the campus for one day only, into a giant festival of alcohol consumption and day-party concerts.[67] This cornerstone event of student life however had more modest origins.[68][69][70][71]

In the summer of 1959, arts student Alan Arthur was ridiculed for wearing shorts in public,[72] an apparent uncommon occurrence for men during the time. In the following year, on Thursday, 31 March 1960, Arthur who was the inaugural Associate-Editor for the newly created student-run newspaper the Gauntlet at the time,[73] took to the campus advertisement board and wrote in chalk, words of what would become the start of a campus tradition. It is hotly contested what the original words were exactly, but one variant goes that Arthur wrote "Tomorrow is Bermuda Shorts Day. Everyone wear Bermuda Shorts.[69][72][74]" Arthur has stated that he wrote the now immortal words, in part to the arrival of warm spring weather,[74] in jest as a light-hearted April Fools joke,[71] and as an unlikely way to reduce stigma around men donning short-cut trousers.[70][72] The famed arts alumnus, Maurice Yacowar – who strangely enough, was The Gauntlet's inaugural Editor-in-Chief at the time – was a contemporary and personal friend of Arthur. Yacowar recalls that many individuals of the UAC's 250 student population stayed true to Arthur's announcement, and wore Bermuda shorts that April Fools of 1960.[74] The first BSD, according to Arthur and Yacowar, was a more innocent affair, featuring a highly competitive marbles tournament.[69][71][74]
Due to a controversial article entitled "Don't Wear a Poppy,"[75] Yacowar was abruptly fired from his position as Editor-in-chief just five months in,[76][77] receiving a 56.4% student-wide favourability rating against his dismissal.[77] He was then succeeded by his friend Arthur, becoming the second Gauntlet Editor-in-chief.[77] The pair would later graduate in 1962 to pursue lives in academia. Arthur who received a degree in History would later become a – now retired – Professor of History from Brock University[69] while Yacowar, who received a degree in English, would become Emeritus Professor of English and future Dean of Humanities here in the University of Calgary.[69] However, little did Arthur know just how powerful those 9 words would become, as the event gained increasing popularly for students to destress before exams.[67][72][78] The BSDs of later years would feature pie duels with the University President,[79][80] musical gatherings in Administration,[81] games of squamish,[82][83] and a tricycle race between SU representatives.[84][85] In 1989, the University with the Student's Union introduced the BSD of modern day, with a single area which included the concert grounds and beer gardens.[72]



Greek life[edit]
See also: Fraternities and sororities in Canada
The Chi Gamma Chapter of the Zeta Psi Fraternity was chartered at the University of Calgary on December 9, 1967, and is the oldest Greek organization on campus. As such, the chapter has been contributing to campus life for over five decades. Zeta Psi - Chi Gamma has several hundred alumni that continue to support both the active chapter as well as the University of Calgary. For over 40 years the Zete Haus has provided economical student housing and has been a focal point for Greek life, being the closest chapter house to campus at approximately 500 meters from MacEwan Hall. The Chi Gamma chapter reactivated in 2014 with 20 members, after having been deactivated in 2008 due to a lack of competitiveness on campus. The active and alumni chapters of Chi Gamma collectively celebrated their fiftieth anniversary on December 9, 2017.
The Mu Lambda Chapter of the Kappa Sigma fraternity was founded in 1981. The Mu Lambda chapter house is located on 24 Avenue NW, approximately one and a half kilometres from the University of Calgary.
The Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, also known as Fiji, is one of the three other fraternities present at the university. Founded in 1982, Phi Gamma Delta is the most recent Greek Fraternity to establish a chapter at the University of Calgary. The Fiji chapter house is located on 24 Avenue NW, approximately one kilometre from campus.
Alpha Gamma Delta and Alpha Omicron Pi are the two existing sororities at the U of C, having been established in 1983 and 1985 respectively. Together, they form the Panhellenic Association of Calgary and are part of the global Panhellenic community.
The Omega Chi Chapter was formally initiated into the Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity on March 12, 2005, becoming the 302nd active branch[86] and the 14th in the Northwest Region.[87]
Leadership on campus[edit]
In 2009, the University of Calgary's Office of the Student Experience (now the Student Success Centre) launched their own co-curricular record, the first of its kind in western Canadian universities.[88] The co-curricular record is an official university document that can be coupled with a student's academic transcript, that recognizes out-of-classroom experiences that are still connected to the university. The Student Success Centre (SSC). The SSC offers programs and services to support students in creating: (1) Academic Success, (2) Personal Success, and (3) Career Success. The SSC offers Orientation Programs, Personalized Career Planning Sessions, Career and Life Workshops, Leadership Programs, the First-Year Experience Program, the Senior-Year Experience Program, Arts & Science Program Advising, Learning Support Services, and Writing Support Services.
In April 2011, the University of Calgary launched the Scholars Academy Program: a program for students that excel beyond just mere academics.[89]
The University of Calgary also offers the President's Award for Excellence in Student Leadership to five graduating students (undergraduate or graduate) that represent academic achievement in addition to extracurricular contributions to the university and community.[90]
Scholarships and Awards[edit]
The University of Calgary offers many scholarships, awards, and bursaries to students.
A notable high school level scholarship is the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship which was introduced by the Government of Alberta in 1980. The Alexander Rutherford scholarship is to recognize and reward exceptional academic achievement at the senior high school level and to encourage students to continue their studies. To be considered for these scholarships, students must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident who plan to enroll or are enrolled in a full-time post-secondary program of at least one semester in length.[91]
The University joined Project Hero, a scholarship program cofounded by General (Ret'd) Rick Hillier, for the families of fallen Canadian Forces members.[92] Dependents of Canadian Forces personnel killed while serving in active military missions will have the support of the University of Calgary to complete undergraduate degrees.
The office of the Chancellor and Senate offers many scholarships, awards, and bursaries to University of Calgary students who demonstrate outstanding academic achievement and exceptional service to the internal and external community.[93]
In 2011, the University of Calgary joined the Schulich Leader Scholarship program. Through this initiative, each year the university awards one $80,000.00 scholarship to a student entering the Schulich School of Engineering and one $60,000.00 scholarship to a student entering a Science, Technology or Mathematics program at the University of Calgary.[94]
Top students in the Schulich School of Engineering are recognized as Schulich Scholars and are awarded prestigious Schulich Entrance Scholarships.[95] The first cohort of Schulich Scholars graduated in 2010–2011.[96]
Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Health Sciences Program are eligible for the O'Brien Centre Continuing Scholarship, which supports full-time students dedicated to extra-curricular involvement and the community on top of their academics.[97]
Graduate students are also eligible for the prestigious Queen Elizabeth II Graduate Scholarships. Awards are available in thirds, two-thirds, or full increments, and are valued at $10,800 at the Master's level and $15,000 at the PhD level. These are provincially-funded awards and are available to graduate students at some other Albertan post-secondary institutions.
The University also offers student awards for academic and leadership excellence. The two biggest awards a student can receive are the[98] President's Award for Excellence in Student Leadership and the Arch Future Alumni Award.[99]
Aboriginal[edit]
The University of Calgary recognizes Aboriginal students, and has instituted an Aboriginal Admissions Policy [section A.13] and Aboriginal Student Access Program (ASAP) [section A.14], as dictated in the Undergraduate Admissions section of the annual calendar. Any student with Aboriginal ancestry (First Nations, Inuit, Metis) and legal status may apply and be considered under the policy. More information can be obtained online at the University of Calgary's website.[100]
Order of the University of Calgary[edit]
The Order of the University of Calgary, developed in 1994 resulting from a suggestion brought forward from the University's Senate, honours worthy recipients who have a record of exemplary and distinguished service to the University. Individuals who have been admitted into the Order have included faculty, staff, students, alumni and volunteers. Young aboriginal leaders such as Spencer Saurette have caused an increased awareness in aboriginal heritage and traditions on campus.[101] It is available to any member of the University community, those currently or formerly attached to the University and to those representing the University in the community. Candidates nominated for membership in the Order may include, but are not limited to, current or former faculty, staff, students (graduate or undergraduate), alumni and volunteers.
The Order of the University of Calgary includes numerous personalities of note including the likes of Dr. Eldon R. Smith. As of November 2009, a total of 114 individuals had been admitted into the Order.[102]
Connor Neurauter Controversy[edit]
On January 4, 2018, 21-year old Connor Neurauter was sentenced to 90-days in jail, 2 years probation and had to register as a sex offender in Kamloops, B.C after obtaining and threatening to share photos of a minor under 16. It was then revealed that Neurauter would not serve his sentence until May 2018, in order to allow him to finish his semester at the University of Calgary. On January 6, the University of Calgary said that they were "reviewing the situation" and he had been advised to not be on campus the week of January 8. On January 9, a petition on change.org was started and as of January 12, has obtained over 65,000 signatures calling for the University of Calgary to expel him. The University of Calgary released a statement on January 11 stating they had no plans to expel Neurauter, but saying he had been advised to stay off campus for the remainder of the semester and that he would be escorted off campus if he appeared. The university has received criticism for its decision to not expel Neurauter and it's handling of the case in light of its new sexual assault policy. The decision to have Neurauter's sentence delayed in order for him to attend has also received criticism.[103][104][105]
