Members and years of admission[编辑]
The federation was founded by the national bandy associations in Finland, Norway, the Soviet Union and Sweden.
The Soviet membership was taken over by Russia in early 1992, following the dissolvement of the Soviet Union in December 1991. For two months, the former Soviet Union national bandy team appeared as Commonwealth of Independent States, but the CIS was never formally a member of the FIB.

Former members[编辑]
 Soviet Union 1955–1991: When the international federation was founded in 1955, the Soviet Union was one of its founding members. The Soviet national federation was called the Federation of bandy and field hockey USSR (Федерация хоккея с мячом и хоккея на траве СССР). The Soviet Union had a national bandy team for men and a national bandy team for women. When the Soviet Union was dissolved in December 1991, the national team came to represent the Commonwealth of Independent States for some months. In 1992, Russia took over its place in FIB.
 West Germany/Germany 1990–1991: Before the present German Bandy Association was founded in 2013, there had been an earlier, short-lived German federation, which was a member of FIB from January 1990 until March 1991, when it voluntarily choose to leave.[1][2] In its short life span, it still overlived the German reunification in October 1990.




A world map showing all the member countries before the defunct associations were taken from the membership list of FIB.


A number of national federations have been admitted as members during the years[3] but then for different reasons not survived, often because of a lack of interest in the sport in their countries. In early 2017, these federations were removed from the member list of FIB.[4] These defunct national federations were:

 阿根廷, Bandy Federation of Argentina, admitted to FIB in 2008.
 澳大利亚, Australian Bandy League, admitted to FIB in 2006.
 丹麥, Bandy Federation of Denmark, admitted to FIB in 2014
 愛爾蘭, Bandy Federation of Ireland, admitted to FIB in 2006
 義大利, Italian Bandy Federation, admitted to FIB in 2003
 波蘭, Bandy Federation of Poland, admitted to FIB in 2005
 塞爾維亞, Bandy Federation of Serbia, admitted to FIB in 2006
