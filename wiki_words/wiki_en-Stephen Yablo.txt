Education and career[edit]
His Ph.D. is from University of California, Berkeley, where he worked with Donald Davidson and George Myro. In 2012, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Work[edit]
In 1993, he published a short paper showing that a liar-like paradox can be generated without self-reference. He has published a number of influential papers in philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and metaphysics, and gave the John Locke Lectures at Oxford in 2012, which formed the basis for his book Aboutness, which one reviewer described as "an important and far-reaching book that philosophers will be discussing for a long time."[2]

Thoughts (Philosophical Papers, volume 1) (Oxford University Press, 2009)
